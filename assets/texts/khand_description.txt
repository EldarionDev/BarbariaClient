Khand lies southeast of Mordor, and east of Near Harad. 
Its people are known as the Variags, and are nomadic in nature. 
Though little is known of them, other than they are allied with the Dark Lord. 
With Rhun they may have been on and off at war, but it wasnâ€™t until the time of the Wainriders that they united under one banner: their utter hate for Gondor! 
These nomads prefer mounted warfare to footbound fighting, 
with its elite being made up from the warriors from Nurad and not to forget to mention the very deadly Brotherhood.
