Angmar is a region to the far north of the Misty Mountains. 
It wasfounded by the Lord of the Ringwraiths, the Witch-king, for the sole purpose of destroying the Dunedain of the North. 
Rhudaur was the first of the three kingdoms to fall, 
for having the least Dunedain remaining there and its throne being seized by an evil Hill-man who allied with the Witch-Realm of Angmar. 
It was the armies of Cardolan and Arthedain that maintained a line of defence along the Weather Hills. 
The Witch-king commanded a vast array of Orcs, Trolls, and Wights in his massive hosts, ready to put an end to the already beleaguered Dunedain.
