Numenor, or Westernesse in Common Speech, is the isle of Elenna that was raised by Ulmo, Lord of Waters, 
as a gift to the Edain in gratitude for their aid in the War of Wrath. 
Its people were called Numenoreans, and they had considerable influence over the Second and Third Ages of Middle-earth, 
and their military was known far and wide as the most powerful the world has ever seen. 
Their legions boast proud and sturdy armour and arms, their archers wield the dreaded steelbow, 
and their marines are versatilely trained in the art of javelin harrying and frontline fighting.
