Greenwood the Great is a vast and expansive forest in the Wilderland. 
As the shadows crept in, and sickness fell over, this once proud forest became a dreary sight with the arrival of Sauron in Dol Guldur. 
To be come to be known as Mirkwood, or the Forest of Great Fear. 
Elves began to inhabit this woodland from the Second Age onwards under King Oropher, where he made Amon Lanc the Wood Elf capital. 
It wasn’t until after the War of the Last Alliance, with the death of Oropher, that Thranduil moved his realm north and established the Elvenking’s Halls. 
The Wood Elves have many patrols in their forest realm, and guarding the halls itself are only the finest palace warriors that are outfitted in strong 
yet light Elven armour that the smithies of the caves produce.
