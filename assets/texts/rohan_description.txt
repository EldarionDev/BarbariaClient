Rohan is a Middle-men kingdom, descended from the Northmen. 
Its people are herdsmen and farmers, 
and are well-known for their horses in battle. 
Thus, they are Gondorâ€™s most important ally. 
By the oaths of Ciron and Eorl Calenardhon 
was granted to the Eotheod, 
which began their own large kingdom 
and reassured their long-standing friendship. 
The Rohirrim also used old abandoned Gondorian fortresses 
in the White Mountains as their own, 
such as Duharrow and the Hornburg.
