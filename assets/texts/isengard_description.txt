Isengard, or originally Angrenost, is a fortress 
in the southern valley of the Misty Mountains 
near the Gap of Rohan. 
At the center of Isengard 
stood the great stone tower of Orthanc. 
For many years, green things prospered in and around here, 
but it wasn’t until the treason of Saruman t
hat his mind was turned to metal. 
He dammed the River Isen, 
and all things green and fair was burned. 
Saruman’s corruption was complete 
when he used the Orthanc-stone and was enticed by Sauron. 
Saruman began his forging of a mighty Orc army, 
to destroy the world of Men; he would start with Rohan. 
Breeding the feared Uruk-Hai from the pits and forges 
of Isengard he would rule this Middle-earth with Sauron, 
or so he thought.
