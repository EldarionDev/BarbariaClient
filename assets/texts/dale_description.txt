The Kingdom of Dale when it was first founded,
consisted of the City of Dale and the valley 
of the River Running before the Gates of Erebor. 
By the time of the War of the Ring, 
its borders extended far 
to the south and east of Lake-town, 
all the way to the River Carnen. 
Dale prospered with their very good allies 
of the Kingdom Under the Mountain. 
Their markets known far and wide for luxurious goods, 
especially for toys. 
During this economic golden age, so too was Daleâ€™s military. 
Its defence was bolstered 
by ranks of well-trained spears and bows, 
and of course the terrifying wind lance 
which stood watch atop the city. 
The Bardings are famed for their supreme marksmanship, 
rivaling the Dunedain and even some of the Elves.
