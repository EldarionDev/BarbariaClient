Dorwinion lay by the northwestern shores of the Sea of Rhun, 
and from here is made a heady wine potent enough 
to even get the Elves drunk. 
The land is inhabited by a mix of races. 
The most notable are the Avari, or Moriquendi, the Elves 
that didnâ€™t go to see the Light of the Two Trees in Valinor. 
There are also many Elves of Nandorin descent, 
who began the Great Journey but did not complete it. 
The Men who lived in Dorwinion are Northmen, 
but due to this close relation to Elves 
they picked up a thing or two in their ways in battle. 
Elvellyn they are called, Elf-friends. 
They boast heavy armour, and training that comes 
directly from the immortal fighting prowess of the Elves.
