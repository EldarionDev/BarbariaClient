Dol Amroth is ruled as a hereditary princedom in south Gondor, 
as part of the larger fief of Belfalas. 
The land which encompasses Dol Amroth,
is often referred to as Dor-en-Ernil, 
or Land of the Prince. 
Its population is comprised of Men of Gondor, 
while also having some Elvish blood in them due to the coming 
of Elven refugees from Beleriand that escaped the destruction. 
Though this was mostly from before 
the abandonment of Edhellond, meaning Elf-haven. 
Its people are seen as tall, fair, and grey-eyed; 
and its famed Swan Knights strike fear 
into the sturdiest of opponents.
