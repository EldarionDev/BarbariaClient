Erebor, or the Lonely Mountain, 
was a single solitary peak in northeast Rhovanion, 
the source of the River Running, 
and a great Dwarven stronghold: 
the Kingdom Under the Mountain. 
Many riches were mined throughout the Third Age, 
including the Heart of the Mountain. 
The City of Dale was also built by Northmen 
between its slopes. 
To guard this great treasure horde is Erebor’s Ironfoot legion, 
that were made by none other than Dain II Ironfoot 
after the Battle of the Five Armies when he was proclaimed 
King Under the Mountain after Thorin’s death.
