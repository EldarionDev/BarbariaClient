Harad, or Haradwaith, is the name for the vast stretch of land south of Gondor and Mordor; its people were called Haradrim, or Southrons. 
Along the coastline of Harad, the Numenoreans, and later Black Numenoreans and the teachings of Sauron, 
came in contact with its people through trade, to eventually establish settlements and entire cities like Umbar. 
Harad would serve the Dark Lord as a puppet, fighting in numerous wars against their Gondorian rivals to the north. 
Haradâ€™s far off eastern lands contain foul men-creatures and beasts of war that lurk in the deserts and jungles alike.
