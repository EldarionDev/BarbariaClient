Rhun encompasses the lands to the east of Middle-earth, and not much is known of them far past the Sea of Rhun. 
The Men who remained in Rhun after their awakening quickly came under the dominion of Morgoth, and later Sauron, and are called Easterlings. 
The most western areas of Rhun were conquered by Gondor twice, but never fully subdued it until the Fourth Age under King Elessar. 
The Easterlings invaded Gondor and much of Rhovanion many times, with none more fearing then the dreaded Wainriders, and later the Balchoth. 
The warlords of the emperor, muster the Dragon regiments in these times of war. 
Feared legions of well-armed and armoured soldiers capable of taking on even the best of their Western counterparts, for they worship one thing: 
the almighty Dragon!
