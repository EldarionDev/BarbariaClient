Khazad-Dum, latterly known as Moria, 
is the grandest and most famed of the Dwarven mansions. 
For many thousands of years this kingdom thrived 
beneath the heart of the Misty Mountains. 
It was founded in the ancient days, when Durin the Deathless 
first awoke at Mount Gundabad and ventured 
to the valley of Azanulbizar where he gazed into Mirrormere 
(or Kheled-zaram). During the Second Age, 
Khazad-Dum was very prosperous for it was enriched by 
many peoples and craft. The most well-known 
of these friendships was with Celebrimborâ€™s neighbouring 
realm of Eregion, and the most well-known workings 
of these close allies was the magical Ithildin-laiden 
Doors of Durin upon the western gate of the kingdom. 
As the kingdom was beatiful, so were its armies.
Regiments of Dwarven warriors were assembled to protect 
the vast wealth of Khazad-Dum from all who dare to gaze upon it.
