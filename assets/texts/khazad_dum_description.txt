Khazad-Dum, latterly known as Moria, is the grandest and most famed of the Dwarven mansions. 
For many thousands of years this kingdom thrived beneath the heart of the Misty Mountains. 
It was founded in the ancient days, when Durin the Deathless first awoke at Mount Gundabad 
and ventured to the valley of Azanulbizar where he gazed into Mirrormere (or Kheled-zaram). 
During the Second Age, Khazad-Dum was very prosperous for it was enriched by many peoples and craft. 
The most well-known of these friendships was with Celebrimborâ€™s neighbouring realm of Eregion, 
and the most well-known workings of these close allies was the magical Ithildin-laiden Doors of Durin upon the western gate of the kingdom. 
When this kingdom was at its utmost bountiful, its armies were too. 
Great regiments of Dwarven warriors were assembled to protect the vast wealth of Khazad-Dum from all who dare to gaze upon it.
