Umbar is a great haven to the far south of Gondor and the Ethir Anduin. 
It was located in a natural inlet, that made for a great harbour to be established. 
Umbar was originally a trading port city used by the Numenoreans, 
and soon after was made into a great fortress as an answer to the threat of Sauron in Middle-earth. 
However, as the power of Numenor fell to the shadow, 
Umbar became the main base of operations to the Kingâ€™s Men (Black Numenoreans who are loyal to Ar-Pharazon and worship Melkor). 
These Black Numenoreans became powerful over the neighbouring Haradrim, governing lordship over them. 
As more Haradrim flocked into this haven and its ideals, they became known as the Corsairs of Umbar, but still being ruled by the Numenorean elite.
