Mordor, or the Black Land, is a land where the shadows lie. 
It is the domain of the Dark Lord Sauron, 
where he attempts to rule Middle-earth. 
Surrounded by three enormous mountain ranges, 
it was well-fortified against potential invasion. 
Mordorâ€™s Uruk-Hai are a new breed of Orc; 
they are faster and can travel in daylight, 
much like the monstrous Olog-Hai. 
Also known as Black Uruks, 
the armies of Mordor are more dangerous than ever,
as lowly Orcs, 
strong Uruks, towering Trolls march to war 
lead by the cruel Black Numenorean elite.
