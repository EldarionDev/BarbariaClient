The Misty Mountains, or the Hithaeglir, is a great mountain range that divides Eriador from the Anduin. 
Orcs that were bred from Mount Gundabad and Goblin-town began increasing in number to begin the War of the Dwarves Orcs, 
and later would begin harrying the lands of the Free Peoples in Eriador; the Rangers of the North would continue to fight many skirmishes with these Goblins. 
The Orcs fought with numbers, and with what they loved: tinkery. 
While not as well-known in the creation of such mechanisms as the Dwarves by any means, they still knew a thing or two about it. 
Large machines of torture and mass-death was a favourite among the Orc-tribes, particularily something called a mangonel.
