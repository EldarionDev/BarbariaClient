Lindon is the name of Ossiriand before the destruction of Beleriand, but as the world changed became the westernmost lands of Middle-earth. 
The Gulf of Lhun divided the land into Forlindon in the north and Harlindon to the south. 
Gil-galad’s, and later Cirdan’s, kingdom was that of a seafaring one, harbouring great Elven ships that would sail into the West. 
The most notable of the havens is the Grey Havens, or Mithlond. 
The armies of Elves that would come from Lindon were highly trained, and eagerly aided their Arnorian allies push back Angmar. 
They bolster their lines with walls of spears and pikes, supplemented by volleys of swift and accurate javelins and archers.
