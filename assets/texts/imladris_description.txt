Imladris, or more commonly known as Rivendell, 
is an Elven town on the eastern edge of Eriador 
in the Misty Mountains. 
It was established by Elrond as a refuge 
from Sauron after the fall of Eregion. 
This Hidden Valley also had a strong alliance 
with the Kings of Arthedain and Rangers of the North, 
even becoming a safe haven for many Dunedain 
and the heirs of Isildur. 
These High Elves adopt the traditions 
of long ages past in battle, wielding sword and spear 
with a righteous fury not seen in Middle-earth 
since the Valian conquest of Angband.
