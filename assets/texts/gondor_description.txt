Gondor is the southern kingdom of the Realms in Exile, 
that were established by Elendil and his sons. 
Initially, Gondor was comprised of the lands north and south 
of the White Mountains, 
but later much of their northern territories were gifted to 
the Eotheod in gratitude for their long-standing acquaintance 
and aid in the Battle of the Field of Celebrant. 
Gondor is made up of fiefdoms, and each is required 
to come to the support of their capital, Minas Tirith, 
in times of war. 
Its garrison of well-armed soldiers will fight just as bravely 
as any Man of the West. 
And from Ithilien, its rangers station themselves at hidden 
outposts to strike down unsuspecting bands of enemies.
