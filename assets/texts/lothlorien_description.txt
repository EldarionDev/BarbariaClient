Lothlorien is a Silvan Elf realm east of the Hithaeglir, 
and contained the only mallorn trees east of the sea. 
Its first inhabitants were a group of Nandor
who did not cross the Misty Mountains, 
and had called this land Lorinand in their tongue. 
Celeborn and Galadriel would soon come to arrive 
in the Golden Wood of Lorien, where many other 
Noldor survivors from Eregion would take refuge. 
Lorinand would have a strong military 
for when the need to go to war arises. 
Company upon company of archer, axe, and rider 
guard the outer reaches of their forest domain 
and their grand capital of Caras Galadhon.
