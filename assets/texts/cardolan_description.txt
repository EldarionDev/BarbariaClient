Cardolan is one of the breakaway realms of Arnor. 
Its borders were marked by the rivers Gwathlo and Mitheithel in the south and southeast, the Great East Road in the east, and the River Brandywine in the north. 
Cardolan also claimed the lands around Bree. 
Its capital, and most revered lands, is Tyrn Gorthad. 
Or more commonly known as the Barrow-downs. 
From there the last of the Dunedain of Cardolan made their last stand against the tide of the Iron Crown, where ultimately their prince also fell. 
After that war, Barrow-wights inhabited those lands, and they were never to be reclaimed because of it. 
Much of the region remained uppopulated in fact, with the only real place of population be in Breeland, 
and eventually parts of The Shire that lay within the bounds of Cardolan.
