Rhudaur, meaning Trollshaws or ‘Wicked Forest’, 
is the smallest of the breakaway kingdoms of Arnor, 
and stretches from the Weather Hills to the River Bruinen. 
Rhudaur has always been unfriendly 
to the two other successor states, 
as seen by their many conflicts with Cardolan 
over Amon Sul and its Palantir. 
Rhudaur is home to many Mountain Trolls, 
who make trouble in the appropriately 
named Ettenmoors or Troll-fells. 
The last kings of Rhudaur were not of Numenorean descent 
and instead that of the barbaric and tribal Hill-men, 
which leagued with the Witch-king in Angmar 
after the beginning of his usurpation of Arnor. 
These Hill-men (or Dunmen) fight with the ferocity 
of the Orcs and Trolls they both serve and hunt, 
and their numerous hand-thrown projectiles 
make quick work of any advancing army.
